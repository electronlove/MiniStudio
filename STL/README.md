## NeoPixel Articulating Mount

Design and STL files to make mounts for AdaFruit 12 NeoPixel element rings 

	This assembly is designed to hold the 12 LED RGB(W) NeoPixel Ring (e.g. Product ID:2853; https://www.adafruit.com/product/2853). 
	The dimensions of the ring are: 3.68mm (O.D.) x 23.3mm (I.D.) x 325mm and the board fits in snuggly.
	
	
## Print Settings
	Printed supports are only required for the NeoPixel ring holder and should be oriented with the LED groove facing upward.
	The ball joint should be re-oriented with the flat face down.  An infill of 35% is adequate.  When printing in ABS, shrink should be taken into account (e.g. scaling to 104%)

## Preparing the Mounting Holes

	The components have mounting holes for 3mm screws and will need to be threaded with the appropriate sized tap. 
	The ball joint can accommodate a 30 mm screw with a nyloc nut instead of individual screws.
	There should be some play in the joint to allow for movement.
